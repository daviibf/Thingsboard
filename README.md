### Quick API in Python for Thingsboard communication

[Thingsboard](https://thingsboard.io/) is a platform for managing data flow in IoT environments. However, it can also be used for general data stream that is acquired via JSON/REST-REQUEST.

The ideia of this repo is to make available some simple commands in python, Rest API based, for those who are struggling to use `tb-rest-client`([link](https://thingsboard.io/docs/reference/python-rest-client/)). With this simple functions, you're gonna be able to understand easily the JSON format and how the rest api flow works behind the scenes. 

The ideia of the `example_api.py` is being able to create a list of devices automatically via command line from a `devices_names.csv` file.

A great reference to see what can be done simply via Rest API can be checked in Thingsboard's [Swagger](https://demo.thingsboard.io/swagger-ui.html).
